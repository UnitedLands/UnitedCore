  ## UnitedItems
  A plugin which handles custom items, trees, saplings, and more! Info about all the custom items can be found [here](https://github.com/UnitedLands/community/wiki/Custom-Items), this mainly details the plugin usage

  ## UnitedUpkeep
  It's the sole plugin handling our custom upkeep system. This plugin calculates the upkeep needed per-town through a sophisticated formula to help ensure balance. As of now there are no commands or permissions needed to set this plugin up, and it simply just works out of the box. 
  
  ## UnitedProtection
  This plugin is built to protect the Earth world in UnitedLands. This is mainly to perserve the value of ores, since the Earth world is way too rich in ores. Its essentially just a simple listener that checks for placing/breaking blocks. If you're in the Earth world, below y45 (configurable), and not in a town of yours, then you're not allowed to break or place anything. There's also a blacklist for specific blocks (found in config.yml) which bypass these protections. 
  
  Currently there are no commands, but there's 1 permission. 
  
  ### Permissions
  - `united.protection.bypass` - Bypasses Earth protection rules everywhere. 
  
  ## UnitedBrands
  This is perhaps one of the more sophisticated plugins in the list, coming in right behind UnitedItems. This plugin allows you to create Brands, which are pretty similar to towns in the sense that you can invite and manage players in your brand. Brands are currently only limited to one type — Breweries. 
  
  Creating a brewery allows you to add a custom branding on any alcohol that you brew, as well as a custom slogan. Breweries also grant the ability to create 'abnormal' star levels for any drinks you make via buying brewery upgrades. You can get drinks with up to 10 stars (also known as Master Brews) if you properly upgrade your brewery.
